## Some notes

re: Perez and Hetherington

Their interpration is inaccurate. As you've both pointed out that varying the loading/discrimination parameter should matter, not variation to thresholds, difficulties, etc. I ran some simple simulations
in R to point this out. It's simulations.R in the analysis file.

What I did was simple, generated data (n=1000/condition) when DIF occurs due to variation across loadings or variation across thresholds. I then ran a factor model that allows loadings/thresholds to vary or be constrained to equality.
